### Project: Auto Repair Facility Scheduling System

#### Project Overview:
Develop a web-based scheduling system for an auto repair facility. This system should allow customers to schedule appointments for vehicle repairs, view service availability, and receive confirmation notifications.

#### Core Features:

1. **User Authentication:**
   - Implement user authentication for customers and staff (mechanics and administrators).

2. **Service Categories and Details:**
   - Create a system to manage different service categories (e.g., oil change, brake repair) and their details.
   - Include information such as service name, description, estimated duration, and cost.

3. **Interactive Calendar:**
   - Implement an interactive calendar to display available time slots for appointments.
   - Allow customers to select a date and time for their appointment.

4. **Appointment Booking:**
   - Enable customers to book appointments for specific services at available time slots.
   - Implement checks to avoid double-booking and ensure service availability.

5. **Appointment Status Tracking:**
   - Provide a way for customers to track the status of their appointments (e.g., scheduled, in progress, completed).

6. **Notifications:**
   - Implement a notification system to send confirmation emails or SMS messages to customers upon successful appointment booking.
   - Send reminders before the scheduled appointment time.

7. **Admin Dashboard:**
   - Create a dashboard for staff to view and manage scheduled appointments.
   - Include features for updating appointment statuses and managing service availability.

8. **Customer Profiles:**
   - Allow customers to create profiles with their contact information for easier appointment scheduling.
   - Enable customers to view their appointment history.

9. **Feedback and Reviews:**
   - Implement a system for customers to leave feedback and reviews after completing their appointments.

10. **Accessibility and Responsiveness:**
    - Design the system with a responsive interface for accessibility on various devices.

#### Learning Goals:

1. **Web Development with Flask:**
   - Learn and apply Flask concepts for routing, templates, and forms.

2. **Database Integration:**
   - Use a database (e.g., SQLite or PostgreSQL) to store information about services, appointments, and user profiles.

3. **User Authentication and Authorization:**
   - Implement secure user authentication for both customers and staff.
   - Define roles and permissions for different user types.

4. **Interactive Web Elements:**
   - Implement interactive elements such as calendars and form validations using JavaScript or a library like jQuery.

5. **Notification Systems:**
   - Explore sending emails or SMS notifications using Flask extensions or third-party services.

6. **Admin Dashboard Design:**
   - Design a user-friendly admin dashboard for managing appointments and service availability.

#### Project Phases:

1. **Planning:**
   - Define project requirements and features.
   - Design the database schema.

2. **Setting Up the Project:**
   - Set up the Flask application.
   - Initialize the database.

3. **User Authentication:**
   - Implement user authentication and authorization.

4. **Service Management:**
   - Develop the functionality for managing service categories and details.

5. **Interactive Calendar:**
   - Create an interactive calendar for displaying available time slots.

6. **Appointment Booking:**
   - Implement the appointment booking system.

7. **Notifications:**
   - Integrate a notification system for confirmation emails or SMS messages.

8. **Admin Dashboard:**
   - Build an admin dashboard for staff to manage appointments and services.

9. **Customer Profiles:**
   - Implement customer profiles for easier appointment scheduling.

10. **Feedback and Reviews:**
    - Add the functionality for customers to leave feedback and reviews.

11. **Testing:**
    - Conduct thorough testing of the entire system, including user authentication, appointment booking, and notifications.

12. **Documentation:**
    - Document the system's architecture, features, and how to use it.

13. **Deployment:**
    - Deploy the application to a hosting server.
    - Configure production settings.

14. **User Training:**
    - Provide training for staff on using the admin dashboard and for customers on scheduling appointments.

15. **Maintenance and Updates:**
    - Plan for ongoing maintenance and updates based on user feedback and evolving requirements.
