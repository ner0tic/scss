### Project: Attendee and Group Scheduling System

#### Project Overview:
Develop a web-based scheduling system that allows users to schedule attendees and groups to multiple facilities. This system should consider the availability of facilities, group preferences, and individual attendee preferences.

#### Core Features:

1. **User Authentication:**
   - Implement user authentication for administrators and users.

2. **Facility Management:**
   - Create a system to manage different facilities, including details such as name, location, and capacity.

3. **Attendee and Group Management:**
   - Allow administrators to add, edit, and delete attendees and groups.
   - Include details such as names, contact information, and preferences.

4. **Facility Availability:**
   - Implement a calendar or schedule view to display the availability of facilities over time.
   - Allow administrators and users to view and manage facility bookings.

5. **Scheduling Preferences:**
   - Enable attendees and groups to specify their scheduling preferences.
   - Consider factors such as preferred facilities, dates, and time slots.

6. **Automated Scheduling Algorithm:**
   - Implement an algorithm to automatically schedule attendees and groups based on their preferences and facility availability.
   - Consider optimization to minimize conflicts and maximize satisfaction.

7. **Confirmation and Notifications:**
   - Send confirmation emails or notifications to attendees and group leaders upon successful scheduling.

8. **Admin Dashboard:**
   - Create a dashboard for administrators to view and manage facility bookings, attendee details, and group preferences.

9. **Reporting and Analytics:**
   - Generate reports on facility usage, popular time slots, and attendee satisfaction.
   - Implement analytics for administrators to make informed decisions.

10. **Accessibility and Responsiveness:**
    - Design the system with a responsive interface for accessibility on various devices.

#### Learning Goals:

1. **Web Development with Flask:**
   - Learn and apply Flask concepts for routing, templates, and forms.

2. **Database Integration:**
   - Use a database (e.g., SQLite or PostgreSQL) to store information about facilities, attendees, groups, and bookings.

3. **User Authentication and Authorization:**
   - Implement secure user authentication for both administrators and regular users.
   - Define roles and permissions for different user types.

4. **Interactive Web Elements:**
   - Implement interactive elements for scheduling preferences and facility availability using JavaScript or a library like jQuery.

5. **Scheduling Algorithms:**
   - Explore and implement scheduling algorithms to efficiently assign attendees and groups to facilities based on preferences.

6. **Notification Systems:**
   - Integrate a notification system for confirmation emails or notifications to users.

7. **Admin Dashboard Design:**
   - Design a user-friendly admin dashboard for managing facility bookings, attendee details, and group preferences.

#### Project Phases:

1. **Planning:**
   - Define project requirements and features.
   - Design the database schema.

2. **Setting Up the Project:**
   - Set up the Flask application.
   - Initialize the database.

3. **User Authentication:**
   - Implement user authentication and authorization.

4. **Facility and User Management:**
   - Develop functionality for managing facilities, attendees, and groups.

5. **Facility Availability:**
   - Create a visual representation of facility availability (calendar or schedule view).

6. **Scheduling Preferences:**
   - Implement forms for attendees and groups to specify scheduling preferences.

7. **Automated Scheduling Algorithm:**
   - Design and implement the scheduling algorithm.
   - Ensure optimization for conflict resolution.

8. **Confirmation and Notifications:**
   - Integrate a notification system for confirmation emails or notifications.

9. **Admin Dashboard:**
   - Build an admin dashboard for managing facility bookings, attendee details, and group preferences.

10. **Reporting and Analytics:**
    - Implement reporting features and analytics for administrators.

11. **Testing:**
    - Conduct thorough testing of the entire system, including user authentication, scheduling algorithms, and notifications.

12. **Documentation:**
    - Document the system's architecture, features, and how to use it.

13. **Deployment:**
    - Deploy the application to a hosting server.
    - Configure production settings.

14. **User Training:**
    - Provide training for administrators on using the admin dashboard and for users on scheduling attendees and groups.

15. **Maintenance and Updates:**
    - Plan for ongoing maintenance and updates based on user feedback and evolving requirements.
